### Introduction to VANTIQ Development
The Engine Monitor tutorial walks through developing and testing VANTIQ Apps and Clients to monitor the speed and temperature of an engine. 
An app is used to process the stream of sensor readings and detect anomolous conditions in the engine, and a client is used
to visualize the data and display any alerts as they occur.
