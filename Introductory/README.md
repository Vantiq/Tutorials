### Introduction to VANTIQ Development
The Engine Monitor tutorial walks through developing and testing a Vantiq Design Model to monitor the speed and temperature of an engine. The SpeedEvent and TemperatureEvent Inbound Event Types are implemented with Visual Event Handlers to process the stream of sensor readings and detect malfunction conditions in the engine. A Client is used to visualize the data and display any alerts as they occur.
